      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Welcome to my website! Here is my first step in a long process to learn web development</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I was born and raised in Utah. Raised in Millcreek, Utah, I attended Olympus High School and Salt Lake Community College.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>My biggest hobby is sports. I love to watch and play any sport I can find.  My favorite is definitely basketball. I am a big Utah Jazz fan. I also love to ride my motorcycle; especially up and down our many beautiful canyons.  Other hobbies include being outdoors, music, and interesting podcasts!</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>I would love to become a web developer for a fast growing and exciting tech company.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I live in Millcreek, Utah</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>Computer programming is a field that I always found interesting, but felt I never could learn to do. After talking to some family and friends that work in the field, I decided that I would dip my hand into the waters. Upon being interesting, programming has skills that will be needed as long as there are computers involved in business. I don't imagine computers and technology leaving us any time soon.</p>
